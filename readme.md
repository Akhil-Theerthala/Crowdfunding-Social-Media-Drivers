# Project Description

This project aims to evaluate the impact of social media features on the success of crowdfunding projects. The success is measured based on the number of backers, the ratio of the amount raised to the goal amount, and the overall project outcome.

The project evaluates the impact of likes, shares, and other features on project success. It also examines the influence of inherent social media post characteristics on project engagement.

The study assumes that the model explanations align with human understanding of feature impact on project success.

## Data

The project uses data from social media posts of crowdfunding projects, specifically from Facebook. This choice is due to the platform's popularity.

Note: The project can be extended to further study how different social media characteristics impact project success and engagement.
